## What is a 2D particle system? 
A **particle system** is a method used in computer graphics that uses small sprites (in 2D) to simulate small portions of a fluid or amorphous entities. The illusion of all the particles together creates a vision of a real entity (some examples: fire, clouds, exmplosions, electricity, 'magic', etc.). We use particle systems to create and organise large amounts of these particles.

## How do we achieve it?
1. First of all, we need to think about particles, and how they behave. Particles need to be created and deleted automatically so the system doesn't collapse. Also, they need a starting speed for them, ideally it will be a randomised speed (between fixed parameters) to achieve that special *flashy* effect. It is interesting that particles can also change over time, for example: change colors, sizes, shapes... But after all, they are just ***sprites** that we can treat as animations.

First af all, we know that particles will be created and deleted left and right all the time. To solvent that, particles have a 'lifetime' value that
